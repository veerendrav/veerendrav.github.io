<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello! I am Veerendra V, a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/), working under the guidance of [Prof. Virendra Singh](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/). 

My research focuses on deep reinforcement learning, specifically on` discovering temporal abstractions` that enhance exploration and exploitation in both single-task and multi-task settings. I am particularly interested in leveraging `representation learning methods` and `preference-based learning methods` to induce knowledge priors, enabling the discovery of useful temporal abstractions. My work aims to contribute to the development of more efficient and adaptable reinforcement learning systems. 

Beyond academics, I am an avid reader who enjoys immersing myself in books across genres. I also love playing chess, running, and exploring new ideas that challenge my thinking.
